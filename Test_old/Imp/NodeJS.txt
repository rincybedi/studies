Architecture
===================
1. Node is a program that includes v8 javascript engines + additonal modules that gives us abilities not present inside the browser.
2. Node provides a run time environment for executuings js code.
Earlier (till 2008), we had only  browser like chrome which has  js engine v8 to convert js to machine lang ie only browser used to provide run time enviroment for executing js,
after that, v8 was embedded in C++ program , called as node.exe
3.Node is not a programming lang nor a framework, its a run time enviroment


how it works?
==================
non blocking , Async nature - single thread execute all requests
Uses event queue to process request 
ideal for IO intensive apps 


events :
we have a http class in node which is used to create web servers
that listens to a port and everytime a request arrives at port, 
http class raises event, we listen to that event and we read the request and return response

const event = new EventEmitter()
event.on('eventname' , (eventargs) => {})
event.emit('eventname', eventargs),
