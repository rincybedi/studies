MVC
	------------------------- 
	Action Selectors = ActionName and ActionVerbs
	Restrict access to public methods - using NonAction attr 
	------ 
	Action filters = to controller or methods - pre/post processsing logic 
	Authorize and AllowAnonymous actio n filters in mvc
	helper:
	@Html.Action("actionName", new {paramName= new{
		...
	}});  or 
	
	@{
	@Html.RenderAction(...) // returns void so wrap inside this @{}	
	}
	
	If you dont want an action method be navigateble by url but somehow accesible inside another view - use [ChildActionOnly] attr. mainly used for caching portions of view
	
	
	[OutputCache(Duration="in sec"] request is cached, test with printing time
	to cahce portion o result use [childaction] + [cache..] attr, using childaction is not necessary for caching 
	Cache profile in config (like add key/value) so as not to maintatin [outputCache] attr for each action,use this key in named parameter for outputCache attr
	[RequireHttps] forces an action to be handled in https prototcol - data is encrypted 
	By defautl, request is validated in action by mvc to not allow html inputted to pevenet xss attacks, we can turn it offf using [ValidateInput(false)]
	Design custom action filetr  to log details of controller /a ction/any exception -

	4 types of filtes = say result filter  ResultFiletr inherits IResultFilter whuich has 2 method:
	OnresultEcectuted ,  , (pre n post ) , samne for all fletrs
	1.Authorzation filter - Authorize, requirehttps
	2. Action 
	3.Result OutpoutCache
	4 Exception - HanfleError
	FIle.AppendAlltext(Server.Map(path), content);
	--------
	MVC Authorize attribte :
	By def, [AllowAnonymps] AUTHENTICATION  is enabled, go to iis and enable window authen
	[Authorize(Roles=")] or [Authorize(Users=")]
	methid()
	now, it will aks windows user creds for accesing that methdo 
	
	[handleErrror]
	When there is exception at an action method say Inex(), it will goto yellow screen of deatth, which is bad
	 handle by 2 ways:
	 1. in config <customerrors mode="on">
	 2. Add Error View to Shared folder; and it takes to error page now on exception, how?
	 in global.asax , we have a call to registerglobalfilters(), there we have handleerror attr
	for handling error for diff http status codes- add Error controller , and add action method which opens up specific view, in config , add redireUrl to that that action
	 
	
	
	

	Action result is abstract class which has method called abstarct ExecuteResult, each derived types of ActionResult like vieresult, jsonresult has their sepcifi implementation for this method
	Using displayname, displayformat, scaffoldcolumn attributes
	datatype and displaycolumn attributes

	Areas - AReaRegistration.cs  which has RegiserArea()
	All areas are registerd in global asax file in ApplicationStart
	When u define multiple areas, default page will search for Home COntroller in all areas and get confued, so neeed to sepcidy namespace in MapRoute for default controller
	To switch between diff areas using Action Link , use overloaded version where area name is paased
	------
	StringLength attribute - dont define this attr in property in autogenerated designer file by ado, instead add partial class
	Add MetadataEmp class and use Metadata attr to link to Emp class, add attrs in MetadataEmp
	Range attr
	Creating custom validation attribut like for Daterange(Min to CurrentDateTime) - add class inheriting RangeAttr, evoke :base(min, currentDate)
	 Enable client side validation - add key EnableClientValidation to true in config
	 Unobtrusive JavaScript
	Compare attribute for confirm emails/passwords
	RegularExpression attribute
	Remote validation in asp net mvc -
	  public class UserMetaData
		{
			[Remote("IsUserNameAvailable", "Home", ErrorMessage="UserName already in use.")]
			public string UserName { get; set; }
		}
	 Remote validation in mvc when javascript is disabled =
	ModelState.AddModelError(FieldName , msg) or 
	  Create a custom remote attribute and override IsValid) method
	Ajax in MVC =  Ajax.ActionLink() html helper
	AJAX applications are non blocking.]
	Better performance and reduced network traffic. 
	No screen flicker.
	ViewData and ViewBag 
	
	actionlink html helper
	FormCollection in mvc
	Updatemodel function
	ModelState.IsValid
	RedirectToAction("Index");
	Employee e = new Employee();
	UpdateModel(e); -- Model binding
	for overloaded action methods, use [ActionName("Create")] attribute 
	updatemodel and tryupdatemodel
	decorate properties with attributes
	deleting database records using get request is bad
	including and excluding properties from model binding using bind attribute/UpdateModel/Interfaces

	 CSRF:
	 Cross Site Request Forgery where a malicious user can trick  a valid victim user to goto some page, which has an image or iframe containing a malicious js code  to make request to original server, and if victim user has active session, he may perform uninteded updates or run some malicious code.

	 To prevent this: Use AntiForgerryToken in your view(html helper method) and action method(Attribute)
	 this helper method generates a key(_RequestVerificationToken) and a token(Secret key) as hidden field in your form and save it in cookie.
	 When a request comes , we match the hidden field with cookie value, if they match, then only we send the request
	 This is done so that user make request onky from a page which has this hidden field and  other request to server are invalidated.
