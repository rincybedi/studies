with docker u solves problem - it works on my mc but when deployed it diesnt work

App+ Dependencies + Configuration

here we pack our application with all its dependencies and configuration into a bundle called images
and then we can deploy this image into a diff machine with only 1 command.This command will load our app with all its dependencies into container 

Ex: sql server for linux comes as docker image, u pull this image from docker registry
then u run this image in a container by mapping a port in our container to port in our host machine
docker run -p 1433:1433 -d imagename
this port no is use when running sql server

docker ps =- list all containers that are running

================================================================
before container : Development
every dev whether on linux or mac has to install some services to run any project say postgress sql and redis
configure these services in their local environment
depending on which os they are using, installation process would be different
Many steps where one could go wrong

after container :
no need to install any services directly 
container has its own isolated environment - own os layer with linux based image
Everything packaged in one isolated environment
One command to install the application, regardless of os
Run same app with different versions


before container : Deployment
dev team produces artifact(jar files) with set of instructions for how to configure and setup those artifact in server
Operations team will setup the environment in server tp deploy those applications
Problem : 
Configuration on server needed
Dependency version conflict
Misunderstanding bw dev and ops team as Everything is in textual guide
cases when devs forget to tell anything important about configuration or ops team misinterpreted some instructions

After container : Deployment
Dev and ops work together to package app in containers
No environment configuration is needed in server  except to setup docker runtime in server
only need to run docker cmd to pull  that app or container image stored in some repository and run it
