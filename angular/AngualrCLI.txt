-dev has source maps files(to deug thru compreessed js + css files_), prod dont
	but u can have sm for prod too by ng build --dev  -sm false or prod true
-global styles are extracted to js file in dev , in prod to csss file
-dev dioesnt have minifcation(removing whitespace, comments) and uglificatiobn(shortening var names) and treeshaking(removing unsued code)
-prod has AOT compliation

JIT vs AOT
- Jit compiles the code when needed at run time (jsut in time)
source map exploere
- with aot, appln code is precomplied
		complier code is roughly half of the angualr framwok , with aot we omit it  and reduces apl size
		- the vendor bundle size is drastically reduced
		- with prod build , we get aot compliation, np complier code
-provide cimplation errors while building say:
[innertext="gettesxxxt()" // wrong spelling ; with ng sreve ; doesnt giv eerror while command executing ; we only know the error at run time in browser dev toll window 

ng serve --aot true  // immdeiate error
