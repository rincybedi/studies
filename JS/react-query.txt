RQ:
 react is UI library, no specific lib for data fetching

redux used for global state management, better for client data like modal , theme
for server data - asynchronous, we have issues like refetching, someone updated server datya, but ui is stale, performance optimization
thatsy rq

caching
say we have 2 headers : normal api and rq api
if w e click normal api, everytime we say a loading indicator is
if we click rq api, we see loading indicator only for the first time

reason is rq data is cached for a given key for 5mins by def, next time if same query is called, it refetches in background instead of fetching(isRefetching instead of isLoading).
Refetching is done to avoid stale data issue in cache is server data might have updated.if data has changed, it will reflect new changed data in ui instead of going from empty screen to populated screen

we can configure:
cacheTime : 5s // after 5s query becomes inactive 
staleTime : 5s //if we know the static data is not going to be changed and we want to void subsequent api calls and use stale data  //after 5s , query becomes stale from fresh

refetchOnMount : true //reftch data is stale
refetchOnWindowFocus : true// everytime tab loses focus and gain focus, api is called
refetchInterval:2s //polling
enabled : false // call api on event
select: (data) =>{} //data transformatuon

//json server 
//rq with params
//rq with Pagination
// rq with infiniteQuery - takes an0other param , a fn thats boolean: hasNextPage
