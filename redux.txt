redux is a predictable state container for js applications
predictable : todo list - item can go from pending to completed state, we can easily predict state transitions  and time travel

why need redux if component hold state?
to avoid lifting state using props (prop drilling) up the component tree if any other component needs the same state like username
when there are multiple components which need common state, state management can be difficult
in redux - state is contained outside of the component 
we have context to solve this

redux 3 concepts:
Store,
Action 
Reducer
