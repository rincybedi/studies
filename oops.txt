Interfaces can be used for :

1. testability: we cant mock a class which has dependencies on other classes in unit testing, so better to use Interface in constructor and let the client class defines the concrete class for same purpose

2. Extensibility: we can  various have types of logger  classes like FileLogger or MailLogger and use OCP and we dont have to change our functional module at all

3 DI
4 polymorphism
5 Let us program to abstraction and not implementation
6. Loose coupling
7. Contract, enforce rules
