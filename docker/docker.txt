with docker u solves problem - it works on my mc but when deployed it diesnt work

App+ Dependencies + Configuration

here we pack our application with all its dependencies and configuration into a bundle called images
and then we can deploy this image into a diff machine with only 1 command.This command will load our app with all its dependencies into container 

Ex: sql server for linux comes as docker image, u pull this image from docker registry
then u run this image in a container by mapping a port in our container to port in our host machine
docker run -p 1433:1433 -d imagename
this port no is use when running sql server

docker ps =- list all containers that are running
