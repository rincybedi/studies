	I is an American owned HVAC company.It goes to market under 4 to 5  official brands.Metallaire  supllies air quality products, dampers, fans etc.
TCF: It is a manufacturere and leading designer insdustry of high quality  custom, semi custo and statndar fans ranging frm heavy duty industrial 	to commercial fans for HVAC industires

Replacemnet Parts / Spare Parts like Motors & Drives, Impellers, Belts, Bearings, 
Axial fans  for low pressure and high airflow  like in computers

Centrifugal fans for  high pressure systems like air conditions 

Maint Pages: Each page is encapsulation of usercontrol ie ascx , resp js and css files. Provides basic fucntionlities like Add, Columns, Export, Print, Search, Pagination, CRUD operations and many more

We use KendoGrrid for maintenance,A kendogrid uses kendodatasoucre which defines url for CRUD operations and has Schema contaning fields, their types, validation events, filters etc
 We define different configuraton options for a kendo Grid like sortable, columnMenuInit, databound , toolbar, edit events etc. These events could be custom methods
 
 SA 
 ..........................
 : Customer before sending Order to release request for  specia Discount in % or $ amount on Total List Price,  Customer Service reviews this request and approve/reject this request. There are some cases where a Project must have SA approved before any of its item is sent to release. It maybe on Product or Value or Shipping  Terms of Project.
 So we have table :
 
 SMR :
 Id,
 ProjectGuid,
 SmrStatus //FK
 RequestedByGuid
 RequestedOn
 requestedDiscount%
 approvedDiscount% on TotalList Price of Project
 
 //if all items are approved, project smr is approved
 lineitem:
 Id, 
 LiItemGuid
 
 say if a project has 2 items:
 1 when project multiplier is updated, prices using that mult is processed for each item(say 10% discount)
 2 when an item mult is updated, for new net price, total discount and % are calculated
 
 
Commission:
.................................
So we have 2 types of billing in Project: Direct Bill and Buy/Resell
In Buy Resell, Rep buys orders from Tcf and sells to Customers
in Direct Bill, Tcf directs charges Reps' customers.
Pricing for a product is structured Tcf and Rep both makes a commission. 
Commission Schedule: Rep Cost Vs Commission entry against each Sell Multiplier, Sell Mult is editable.

Notification:
.................................
When a LI/Project is added
When a SMR is created or its status changes
When a release is created or its status changed


We have table: COnversation, COnversationAttachment and COnversationNote:
For each conversation attachment or note , an entry is made in ConversationNote table with Conversation FK Guid.
We have ConversationType for Project / Sa and order.A Sp is made to read top n of those ConversationNotes from each types using joins and union.


 Authorization of Pages and Accessibility to different functionalities:
 ...................................
 SubMenu : 
 SubMenuName , SmartUrl etc
 JoinUserGroupSubMenu : UserGroupGuid , SubMenu
 
 When a user logs in , AlphaCPQ_GetListOfAuthorizedSubMenus takes its roles, IsSuperUser, MenuTypes and retuns list of auth menus
 
 if we enter a url , we check in codebehind is for that smart url, user is authorized or not.
 
 SA Review and Order Review are hidden for diff roles
 
 Several apis arestricted to roles, for that we have CustomAuthorizeAttribute : AuthorizeAttributeBase and it takes role from config, overrides virtual method IsAuthorized
 
 Reports
 ........................................................
 
 So we have a reports page, a usercontrol page where we have default and custom templates.
 For a default teplates, we just have rdl whose design is static, has a datatsource an datatsets, a dataset is basically a sp with some parameters, when we click on Generate report, we open a Report page, which has codebehind to process report.By process report we mean, identifying which report , what all items are needed to show, for which brand, passing paramters to datatsets and rendering report from ssrs server as byte array and storing it in physical location
 
 For a custom template, we can have headers , pricing section, grid columns section configurable, sorting and display order, we have used kendoList for same
 We have a XMLModel  in server side, we serialize this complex model to xml string  against each template
 
 
	Microsoft.Reporting.WebForms;
	LocalReport obj;   Report Builder' tool/wizard;
	create a ReportPage.aspx page having ReportViewer Control,
	shared datasource - for all reports -.rds
	
	
	LocalReprot obj;
	we copy the rdl to a temp folder path and extract dataset and params using xml deserializer
	
	set obje.ReportPath ;
	obje.SubreportProcessing ;
	ReportDataSource rds = new ReportDataSource();
                rds.Name = ds.Name;
                rds.Value = dt;
                report.DataSources.Add(rds);
	report.SetParameters();
	report.Render("PDF", theDeviceSettings); 
	
	 XDocument xmlDoc = XDocument.Load(tempRdlFilePath);
	 XElement.Remove() 
	 For every checked section, we will have bool prop IsVisible, retrive this for every prop to remove XmlElmenet and save the doc back to disk as u process fuirther 
	 
	 using itextSharp, merge pdfs in a Document obj
	 using EpPlus package and Excelreader for xls to convert to List<Model>
