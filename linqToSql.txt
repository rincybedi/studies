Eager vs lazy loading in LInq to sql:
EF wont load related data until we iterate over them or try to acces them (n+1 queries)
Dept-> Employee
Say we want to print employee in each dept(we have 3 records)
there will total 4 queries: 1 for Depts retrieval and 3 for each dept ' employee retrival

if we need eager loading, we canuse data load options:
 DatataOptions.LoadWith<Dept>(d=>d.Employee) and attach this options to dbContext.DatataOptions

 or use projection like :
 var res = dbContext.Dept.Select(d=> new{DeptName= ...,EMployees=...})
