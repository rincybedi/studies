I made a project from scratch using Create React App for React, 
used Mongodb at db, express js at server side for handling route requests and accessing database.

JWT authenication:
jwt.sign takes payload which want to serialize and a scret key
It gives an acces token which we retun to the client, this access token has user info safely signed into it
Content type and Accept
Authorization: Bearer TOKEN in auth header


Middleware is a fn that takes req, res, and next params eg authenticateToken
jwt.verify(token, key, callback)
if user is successfully verfieid, user info is extracted and store in req.user and used in all requests where middleware is used
next()

jwt works wells with several servers

if somebody got access token, he wud have infinte access, so we need to have a refersh token and expirty date. 
after access token expires, need to generate access token using refresh token.


created many screens using fuctional componets, hooks like useEFfect, useState,
Context Api to maintain user state in 1 global store, with serveral dispatch actions.
