I recently requested LG service for fixing  water leaking issue. Yesterday they cam and of the worker broke the2 swings part from ac. He has said that he will get it replaced, but ac is making lot of SOUND and is NOT COOLING now.

This is a new ac, purchased 2 months back and this kind of service from LG is totally not bearable.

 I  request you to REPLACE this product as this ac now has lot of issues within 2 months of purchase.
