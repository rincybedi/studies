why is webpack needed?
There are two ways to run JavaScript in a browser. First, include a script for each functionality; this solution is hard to scale because loading too many scripts can cause a network bottleneck. The second option is to use a big .js file containing all your project code, but this leads to problems in scope, size, readability and maintainability.

Virtual dom
Critical rendering path
EVent loop in browser and nodejs
settimeout and promises in event loop

ES:
nodes in cluster , data in shrads
shrads:
1 increases performance by scaling
2. Node failure - single point of failure
crud:
c: put indexname
index a doc :
post index/_doc{
    "field" :value
}
r: get index/_doc/1
u -
post index/__update/1{
    doc:{
        field:value
    }
}
d - delete index/_doc/1

precision vs recall, ranking(Scoring)
hits in result
get index/_search
{
    query:{
        //Full text queries
        match/match_phrase:{  //proximity and all terms in order
            category:"Entertainlement"
        },
        multi-macth:{
            query:"Michelle obama",
            field:["headline^2, "short_description] //per field boosting.
            type:"phrase"
        }
    },
    aggs:{
        popuplar_in_entertainlement:{ //array of buckets with key and doc_count
            "significant_text" :{
                "field":'headline'
            }
        }
        category_mentions":{
            terms:{
                field:"category",
                size:100
            }
        }
    }  
}

Combined query : bool queries
1 must
2. must_not
3. should(good to have) docs dont need to micth this clause to get hits, but once they do, they get a higher score and will be shown at top
4 filter(yes/no categories) like all article of michelle(must) in certain range(filter by range )

query:{
    bool:{
        must:[
            "match_phrase" :{
                headline:"michelle obama"
            },
            {
                match:{
                    category:"politics"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
